        <h3>Organizations</h3>
        <p>The <span>organization</span> system of the server is <span>dynamic</span> in nature, meaning additions and subtractions can be made whenever necessary/on a whim. These include vehicles, skins, weaponry, and member slots.</p>
        <p>Joining an organization allows a player to wield its <span>weapons</span> and use the <span>skins</span> and <span>vehicles</span> allocated to it.</p>

        <h3>Jobs</h3>
        <p>The server has a wide array of <span>jobs</span> available for players, allowing them to earn in-game money. These jobs include <span>trucking</span> (most popular), <span>farming</span>, <span>bus driving</span>, <span>pizza deliveries</span>, and others. VIP users can also start <span>taxi</span> missions. Besides these, the server offers players the option to <span>export</span> vehicles and climb up the leaderboard within the server.</p>

        <h3>Businesses</h3>
        <p>The <span>business</span> system we offer is <span>dynamic</span> in nature, much like the organizations. Preexisting businesses have <span>shares</span> on offer, which players can invest in (5%-100%). Moreover, players can <span>request</span> business establishments via the forums, worth up to $5 million. Players also have the ability to <span>sell</span> their shares to other players for a price above the market rate, allowing for roleplay opportunities such as profiteering.</p>

        <h3>VIP Ultimate Subscription</h3>
        <p class="description">The VIP Ultimate is the package which offers the most exclusive features. These features include changing vehicles at one's own discretion, and selling them to other players to make handsome profits. Moreover, it allows access to the "CJ" skin, which is not available to other players. It also allows players to learn exclusive fighting-styles and have access to 'VIP vehicles' (such as the Monster Truck). VIP players also have a chat solely made for them, and have the ability to write custom texts in the server chat. These players are also given access to a special VIP-only channel on our Discord server.</p>
